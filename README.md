# WriteDown

WriteDown is a simple, fast, and intuitive CLI note-taking app written in Go. Create, edit, list, and delete your notes directly from your terminal with an easy-to-use interactive menu. This lightweight tool is perfect for capturing quick thoughts without the distraction of a graphical user interface (GUI).

# Compatibility

WriteDown currently works best on Linux/Unix-based shells (e.g., bash, zsh). Windows support is limited due to the differences in the compatibility of running linux commands, but improvements are planned for future releases.
